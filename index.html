            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="./assets/images/My Pic.jpg" alt="Picture of Kate Ritchie" id="my-pic" />
            <p>I am a Colorado native, who loves all things outdoors. Hiking, biking, kayaking, if it's outdoors
                I will be there. When not outside, you can find me reading or hanging out with my family and friends.
            </p>
            <p>Working in accounting for 15+ years, I have always worked on computers and used software. Over the past
                year I have become more interested in the how and why of software development.
                How does it relate to my current field? Why does software development encompass more than just coding?
                Combining the knowledge gained in full-stack coding courses, with my background
                accounting and finance, I provide the ability and experience needed to bridge the gap between accounting
                and development departments to ensure successful outcomes to meet client and
                employer needs.
